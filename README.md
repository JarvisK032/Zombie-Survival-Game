# Zombie Survival Game

# Overview

Hi, My name is Jarvis Kwong.

I'm trying to create computer systems and applications to help the world to become a better place.

This is a game that I created for people to have some fun with their friends and families.

# How To Play

The Zombies are going kill to you, unfortunately your guns in not working.
You have to avoid the Zombies and run to the finish line.

For player one,
use w, a ,s ,d to move.

For player two,
use up,left,down,right.

Let's see who can go to the finish line faster. Good luck!

The link below is a gameplay video of the game.
